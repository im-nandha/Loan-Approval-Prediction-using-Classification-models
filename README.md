# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Classification-models
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on a dataset of applicant details. By applying classification models, the goal is to accurately classify whether a loan will be approved or not. The project employs three machine learning algorithms:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3.Logistic Regression
The models are evaluated to determine their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

# Dataset
The dataset includes details such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, property area, and more. Each record has a target variable indicating loan approval status (Approved or Not Approved). The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
